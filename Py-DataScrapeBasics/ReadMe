Basic Components required - 
1) Script to parse JSON output. JSON parse is best, compared to HTML parsing which can be heavy lifting.But then, not many providers expose JSON output.
2) A sample multithread script that can run code using Queue, locking. 
3) Sample Windows UI generated in Python - cx_Freeze / Qt ? watever
4) A desktop executable generated by 3, that will pull data and possibly Write into .csv/.RData files ? 

We should ultimately create a threaded application, one thread per Product that can pull data across sources. Parser Classes would change as we switch between data sources for different data.
