Building blocks for scanning Twitter
Dirty code, pulls up past Tweets and constructs a wordcloud. Sample Hillary wordcloud attached.

Things to note:
Twitter provides us with Real time as well as archived data. Current code is using Archive. Possibly upgrade to realtime ? 
Each tweet object gives lots of Attributes, that can help analyse/filter the data. Example - Device used( Android,Blackberry,Iphone) User details, Links, etc.
